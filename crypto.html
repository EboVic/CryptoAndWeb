    <h2>BTC Price Spreads Fear At $26k, Is This The Start Of The Bull Run?</h2>

        Bitcoin’s recent drop to $25,000, although expected by many, has left traders and investors afraid of taking new positions. Sentiment across the crypto market remains negative, made worse by projections of another <a href="https://coingape.com/btc-price-dips-target-20k-last-opportunity-before-the-bull-run/?utm_source=24hrsupdatebitcoin" target="_blank"><strong>dip to $20,000</strong></a>
        
        
        
        before BTC price reverses the uptrend significantly. <br> This lack of active participation which often comes after dips, has confined Bitcoin to hovering at $26,000. Attempts to climb toward $27,000 only made it to $26,282 while on the downside bulls set camp at $25,000 in a bid to avert an extended decline.
    
        
        
    <h3>BTC Price Bull Runs Start in Extreme Fear</h3>    
    
    
        Ardent investors in the crypto market are well aware of the Bitcoin cycles, which are often linked to the halving – set to occur in April 2024. These cycles are characterized by periods of euphoria and fear, which mark the beginning of retracements or bull runs, respectively. <br>

        According to @DrProfitCrypto “The last bull run in the end of 2020 started with absolute fear during covid and the mother of all crashes.” The sell-off triggered by the pandemic set Bitcoin on a parabolic climb to new all-time highs of $69,044. <br>

        <q> <strong> <mark> Bull markets always start with extreme fear while bear markets always start with euphoria,</mark></strong></q> the trader and analyst added. <br>
    
        However, what differentiates investors who smile during bull runs and those that buy at the extreme top (euphoria) is timing. Buying during market dips has been proven to be one of the best strategies to build digital assets’ value over time. <br>

    <h2>Valkyrie Rockets Into Action: Files For ETH Futures ETF With SEC</h2>
    
    
    <p>
            Asset management firm Valkyrie has taken a significant step by filing for an Ether or Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) called “Valkyrie Ethereum Strategy ETF” with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). <br>

    <h3>Valkyrie Ether Futures ETF Include Secure Collateral Investments</h3>
            According to the filed documents on August 16, the proposed ETF will not directly invest in Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Instead, it aims to acquire a portfolio of Ether futures contracts. <br>

            These contracts are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), primarily focusing on contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). <br>
        
        
        <p><img src="images/eth.jpg" width="100%" height="600cm"</p>
    </p>
    
        
    <p>
            The value of these futures contracts will be determined by the CME CF Ether Reference Rate, which tracks the price of Ether across selected cash exchanges.<br>

                <br>
            <br> Per the filing, the Fund intends to employ a “rolling” strategy to manage the expiration of futures contracts. As contracts approach their expiration date, they will be replaced by similar contracts with later expiration dates. 

            These contracts allow investors to speculate on Ether’s future price movements without owning the digital asset directly.
